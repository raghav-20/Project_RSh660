Introduction 
This website  is a personal initiative for me that is showcasing my journey which is currently going on as an international student in Canada. It all started in November 2023 when I landed in this beautiful country where challenges were on every single point and thought of helping other newcomers as well in their journey so that’s why I thought of creating a YouTube channel and a community guidance plan to help newcomers especially students to be ready for the challenges they will have to face when they start their voyage in Canada. It also extends to providing different locations in Canada which are worth visiting , exploring the hidden gems of this country and on the same side sharing the resources and providing the assistance when needed.
Website Layout 
I tried my level best to make the most efficient use of the CSS technologies so that my website looks both dynamic and efficient and its user friendly. Starting with the navbar I made it display flex so that items are aligned properly, and space is evenly distributed in them. Same goes for the footer and the social icons I used in footer. Most  of the items I tried keeping flex so that it helps me make the website responsive as well on the same time.
Website Organization 	
The Website consists of 6 pages
•	Home
•	About
•	Appointments
•	Contact Us
•	Essentials
•	Thank you page(which is hidden)
Home : The first page of the website is very easy to understand by the user because its straightway asking a question about whether you are new Canada and seeking any help or guidance from me and my team. With navigation bar on the Top right corner to navigate to other pages. I used a CSS technique under each navigation item like the transform its just like a hover, when you hover on that particular nav item it transforms, and an animation works, and this is same for all the pages. Additionally, I used a JavaScript function which works when the page loads and display some facts about the Canada as well as some rules for being an international student in Canada. The function name is showDynamicContent. 
About : On the page 2, There is  an embedded YouTube video of my own channel – Canadian Voyage as my first day as an international student in Canada at SAIT, Calgary, Alberta along with my brief introduction when the user scrolls the page. This is followed by my photo collage as a explorer in Canada and my YouTube shorts covering news in bits if the user watches it.  I have learned a new constructor intersection through which I tried creating dynamic content on my website that I learned from Stack overflow. 
Appointments: The third page covers the bookings which includes which kind of help which the particular person is seeking so that person can click on the particular topic and book its session with me. I used 3 different divs(id-plan1,plan2,plan3) and when the user hovers on it, their color change I made a JS function for this instead of simply doing by the CSS.
Contact Us:  After clicking on the book now it takes you to the 4th page which is the contact form where all validations are given through JS and after you click the submit button it again asks user to confirm their details and when the user clicks yes, it’s submitted and takes you to page. In this page there is label preferred method of contact in which if a user clicks on the email then it creates an input to fill email which has an validation of an email and vice versa for phone which is a thing to notice about on this page
Essentials:   The 5 page is the kind of a checklist tool for the people who are coming to Canada or who are already here that what are the essentials a person needs when they come to Canada. A cost estimator is something unique which calculates the average cost a family or an individual has to bear in a particular city the user will select. The 6th page is nothing but just confirmation of the submission of the details .
Highlighting the Major Parts of the website
Navbar: The first and foremost in the animation beneath the navbar, it a lot of time to look for it but it’s pretty better than the normal hover.
Fact Display on first Page: Apart from that on the first page how facts are displayed after a set interval of time, is also where I spent time.
Animations on second page: The animateCount function I used to show how many hours of Watch  Time I have created on my YouTube channel as well as how many customers I helped during the phase they needed assistance. 
FORM: 
In the form when the user selects preferred method of content, the thing I wanted is if the user selected email on the input for email should come there and if phone so only phone number that was challenging. 
5Th page: And the cost estimator counter on the 5th page was already taught in class but just played with little bit to make it according to the requirement of my website. The user has to select the city and the family size in order to know the what will be the average estimation cost of living with that particular city and also tried generating some text in other two divs( like checklist generator) using JS.
